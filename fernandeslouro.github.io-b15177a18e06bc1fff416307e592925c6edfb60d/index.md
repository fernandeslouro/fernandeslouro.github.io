I am a recent MSc graduate in Aerospace Enginnering at [Instituto Superior Técnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/). My major is in Avionics/Electronics, with a minor in Control and Systems.

My main interests are electronics and data science/machine learning. You can find some projects I've worked on in my Github account.
