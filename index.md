I am an MSc Aerospace Enginnering student at [Instituto Superior Técnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/), currently working on my master's dissertation in collaboration with [GMV Innovative Solutions](https://www.gmv.com/en/). I'm majoring in Avionics, with a minor in Control and Systems. I expect to graduate in the end of 2018.

My main interests are avionics and machine learning.
