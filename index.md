I am an MSc Aerospace Enginnering student at [Instituto Superior Técnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/). I'm about to defend my master's thesis, developed in collaboration with [GMV Innovative Solutions](https://www.gmv.com/en/). I have a major in Avionics, with a minor in Control and Systems.

My main interests are avionics and data science/machine learning.
