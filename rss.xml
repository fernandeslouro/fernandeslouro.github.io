<h1>Shady Business in the Herbicide Industry?</h1>
Recently, my grandfather unexpectedly passed away. I loved him. His main past-time was winemaking, tending to his wineyard and brewing. Now that he's not here, it comes to us to do the work. The most recent task was to apply the herbicide. I don't like the idea too much, but my father claimed it should be done. I'm new at this, so I didn't object.

I used a tool which allows you to use a lower dose of herbicide, deploying concentrated product direcly where you want it, instead of using higher quantities of dilluted product. The prodct we used was made by the infamous Monsanto, recently acquired by Bayer.

Needless to say, it worked pretty well. In the photo, you can see that the grass in the vine rows is yellowed (i.e. dead). This photo was taken a few days after the herbicide was spread.


Glyphosate workis in a smart way. It interferes with a plant's particular methabolic route which does not exist in the genome of mammals, including humans. This causes proteins which are part of this methabolic route to accumulate in plant tissues. The plant then tries to remove them from its cells, diverting energy and resources away from other processes, which leads to its death. While growth stops within hours of application, it takes several days for the leaves to begin turning yellow (as the grass in my wineyard already has).


Recently, glyphosphate has caused some discussion in the news. After some news in Portugal in which some volunteers where analyzed and glyphosate was found in their system, a public petition for the end of the use of this herbicyde raised 15 000 sinatures, and the issue will ow be brought to parliament. 

Glyhosate is now the most widely used herbicide on the planet. Its last commercially valuable patent expired in 2000, meaning anyone can synthesize the chemical and sell it. This brings its price down, essentially making food cheaper for everyone.

The fact that there are a multitude of products in the marked based on glyphosate, which include added compounds, make the product and umbrella term for what are in reality multiple different herbicides.

The research done on gyphosate has been unconclusive. This is not for lack of interest in tha academic community, since a large nubmer of studies have been conducted on the product. While there are claims it may by carcinogenic, the sientific studies have not been able to prove it. I must now say that I have no interest in having glyphosate be the reference herbicide

Should glyphosate be replaced, its substitute would most likely be a y
